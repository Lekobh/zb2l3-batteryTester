Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a simple, cheap, standalone battery capacity tester from Ebay (around
 $5).
 It connects to the battery and a load resistor, and draws power from a
 microUSB connector (no communications to the computer, just power).
 It draws power from the battery until a predetermined discharge termination
 voltage is reached, whence it displays the integrated Ampere-hours (Ah)
 of battery capacity (it's a pity that Ah is the accepted unit rather than
 Volt-Ampere-seconds, a.k.a Joules).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ebay description is hard to understand, so I edited it into more conventiona
l English.
 All errors therefore are mine---I am uncertain about the details in the
 calibration section, for instance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 are displayed as X.XXX; values between 10Ah and 99.99Ah are displayed as
 XX.XX, and so on).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Board size: 50mm long by 36mm wide, by 17mm high, including standoffs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: in order to improve the voltage measurement accuracy, the circuit
 applies a DC bias.
 The display may show a small residual value, which does not affect the
 actual measurement.

Usage instructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Measured battery should be fully charged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Connect to the tested battery observing the polarity (+ terminal on the
 PCB to positive battery terminal).
 
\series bold
\shape italic
Reversing The Polarity May Damage The Circuit!
\series default
\shape default
 Connect the operating power to the tester via the micro USB cable.
 The display should indicate the battery voltage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start test by pressing the "OK" button.
 The tester will automatically set suitable termination voltage, according
 to the battery full charge voltage, and flash it 3 times upon starting
 the test.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The termination voltage chan be changed in 0.1V increments after starting
 the test, by pressing the "+" or "-" keys.
 The termination voltage is displayed with a leading P character.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
During testing, the electronic switch connects the load resistor, and the
 testing data are displayed in sequence, as shown by the LED indicator:
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the integrated capacity (Ah), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
instantaneous discharge current (A) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
current battery voltage (V)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
When the battery voltage reaches the termination voltage, the tester cuts
 off the load control switch, and displays the capacity (Ah) and rapidly
 blinks the corresponding LED indicator.
 Press "OK" to terminate flashing.
 Pressing the "OK" button again returns to power on state, so that another
 battery can be connected and tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The error codes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Err1: the battery voltage higher than 15V
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Err2: the battery voltage is lower than the setting voltage termination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Err3: the battery is unable to withstand the load discharge current (either
 the internal battery resistance or connector/cable resistance is too large)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Err4: the current is too large (current is more than 3.1A)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apply USB power and simultaneously press all three buttons to enter the
 calibration mode and perform the following steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first calibration step after entering the calibration displays the 0u0A;
 short connect both positive and negative input terminal and press the "OK"
 button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Next, the display will show J10u; apply 10.00V DC between the input positive
 and negative terminal and press the "OK" button again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The display will show J2.0A; apply 2.0 A DC current between the input terminals
 and press the "OK" button to complete the calibration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the tester determines that the calibration data is reliable, it will
 in turn show 4 calibration numbers after completing the procedure; otherwise
 it will ignore the calibration attempt, discard the data and exit the procedure.

Load variation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When testing 12V lead-acid batteries, the load current resulting from the
 provided 7.5 Ω load resistor is 1.6A and the load power is over 19W, far
 exceeding the 5W rating of the resistor.
 I decided to connect the two provided resistors in series, whereas the
 resistors see the current of 0.8A; this brings the power load back to 4.8W
 per resistor.
 I mounted the resistors on a small heatsink from an old graphics card,
 and attached them to a 0.1

 using standard 0.1

 battery voltages

Physical layout of the load circuit: jumper in position 1 results in 7.5Ω
 load, position 2 puts two 7.5Ω resistors in series, giving 15Ω, and two
 jumpers in position 3 connects both 7.5Ω resistors in parallel, giving 3.75Ω

\begin_layout Standard
It would be an interesting circuit modification to connect both resistors
 to the circuit and add more load switches that can reconfigure both resistors
 in various load cinfigurations, depending on the battery voltage.
 I'd also add a temperature sensor to protect the load from cooking.
